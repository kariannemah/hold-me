 The title you've requested may not be in circulation at SFPL. (It happens!) If that's the case, try <a href="http://csul.iii.com/">Link+</a>.
  <br>By definition, Link+ is a "union catalog of contributed holdings from participating libraries in CA and NV." But it's better known
   as a lifeline to rogue researchers near and far.
